# 🌟 How to Use This GitHub Profile README

This guide explains how to set up the **custom GitHub profile README** like the one in this repository.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Create a Special Repository

1. Go to GitHub and click **New Repository**.
2. **Repository name must match your GitHub username exactly**.
   - Example: If your username is `Vishnuuuuuu`, name the repo `Vishnuuuuuu`.
3. Make it **public** and check ✅ **“Add a README file”**.

---

## 🎨 Step 2: Replace the Default README

1. Copy the contents of the file `PROFILE_README.md` (from this repo).
2. Go to your username repo’s `README.md` and **paste it there**.
3. Commit your changes.

Your GitHub profile page will now show this custom README automatically. 🎉

## ⚡ Step 3: Customize for Yourself

- ✏️ Replace my **name, bio, and links** with your own.
- 🎨 Change colors, fonts, or typing animations by editing the `readme-typing-svg` URLs.
- 🖼️ Swap out GIFs/images with your own style.

---

## 🛠️ Optional: Add Stats & Widgets

This README uses widgets like:

- [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
- [Readme Typing SVG](https://github.com/DenverCoder1/readme-typing-svg)
- [Skill Icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons)

You can customize these by editing their URLs inside the markdown.

---

## ✅ Final Result

After saving changes:

- Go to **your GitHub profile page**.
- You should now see your **custom README in action** 🚀.
